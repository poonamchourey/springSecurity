by default when we add spring.security properties in build .gradle file it pop up the credential field in the UI while accessing any kind of API.
Lets say we want to use Oath2.0 then we have to add the oath2.0 dependency and implementation then it will override the default login.
Login ways:
While running the application you can see the password in ui use that
We can provide out own username password in the .properties file.
We can implement password encode through our java classes also.
